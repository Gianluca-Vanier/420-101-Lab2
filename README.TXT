Purpose of project: To illustrate the basics of fields, constructors, and methods.
How to start this project: Create one or more TicketMachine objects.

QUESTIONS:

2. We get the value 0.
3. If too much money is inserted, the machine will print a ticket but the balance
value will become 0 regardless of how much more money than the cost you put in.
If not enough money was put in, the machine will still print a ticket.
5. It does look different. The price displayed at the bottom of the ticket has changed.
6. public class Student or public class LabClass.
7. If it is written as class public TicketMachine, then the class will return an error.
The error message i got was <identifier> expected. Although curretly I don't really understand
what it means, hopefully in the future I will.
